# RandomMessage
Just a bot to randomly send messages you specify to a channel.

This is a bot someone asked me to make, so I just decided to opensource it.

## Installation
Download nodejs from https://nodejs.org, if you haven't already, and optionally yarn, from https://yarkpkg.com.

Then, clone the repo or download it as a zip and extract it to a folder.

If you've downloaded yarn, just open a terminal/command prompt and run the command `yarn`. If you didn't install it, just run `npm i`.

## Configuration
Open the Config.js file in an editor of your preference, and use the guide below to change the values to your preference.

### token
Self-explanatory, just a bot token. Get this from https://discordapp.com/developers/.

### min
This minimum delay in seconds between messages.

## max
The maximum delay in seconds between messages.

## toSay
Just an array of messages the bot'll send.

## Starting
To start the bot, just open a terminal/command prompt in the directory of the bot and run `node index`. If you get any errors this is because you did not follow the installation correctly, or you provided an invalid token.
